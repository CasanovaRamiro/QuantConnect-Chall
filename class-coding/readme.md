# Frontend Developer Test

### Objective
We want to see you follow our style, aptitudes, and how you solve problems in UI by implementing a couple of methods.

### Instructions

This table model has two methods missing implementation; the first one is required to set the page and update the view model, and the second one sorts the data and updates the view. Find the missing methods and implement their functionality. By doing this, you will complete the functionality of the dynamic table that you can test by opening the `index.html` file in your browser. To build the solution, you will need node and the typescript compiler installed; once you have those two, run `tsc` inside the test folder to build a new js bundle.

#### Requirements

1. Must use *Typescript*.
2. Must return the entire `\test` folder in a zip file.
