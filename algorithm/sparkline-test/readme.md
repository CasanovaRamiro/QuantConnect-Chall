# QuantConnect Sparkline test

### Objectives

This test is designed to understand the candidate's ability to design and
implement a solution following object oriented programming in an MVC architecture.

### Instructions

We want to view and compare two sparklines; for this, you will need to reduce the number of values of each data series to a standard 100 points array. To do this, we have designed a simple view page.
(`index.html`) that displays two sparklines, one on top of the other.

You aim to create the models, views, and controllers that will allow you to build the array of values for each sparkline.

- OO code solution in Typescript
- Create two sparklines with 100 points, representative of each data array.
